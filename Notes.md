In this first commit, I am exploring the concepts of the CSS box model.

All the HTML elements are considered as a box
All boxes have certain properties, like content, height, width, margin and others

Now i will learn about those properties

The display property controls how boxes are presented on your site
more details are on index.html

The border will style the border of your box
more details are on style.css

The width and height will determine the width and the height of the box 
more details are on style.css and index.html

The margin will determine the margin of the box
more details are on style.css and index.html

The padding will handle the internal filling of the box
more details are on style.css and index.html
